# AIPredictionModel-TestScores
AI model that predicts test scores using study time and sleep data.
Problem

Students and teachers often wonder how study time and sleep affect test scores. This project aims to predict a student's test score based on the number of hours they studied and slept.

Solution

This project uses a machine learning model to analyze data about study hours and sleep hours. The model learns patterns from the data and predicts a test score when new values are entered.

Tools

Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Linear Regression Model

Google Sheets (to create a dataset)

Results

The AI predicted a test score of 86.3 for a student who studied 6 hours and slept 8 hours.

Learning

One important thing I learned is that AI models learn patterns from data. The more accurate and realistic the data is, the better the AI prediction will be.
